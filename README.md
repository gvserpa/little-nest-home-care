## Project Overview
This project showcases a responsive and interactive landing page for Little Nest. The goal is to provide a friendly and professional online presence for a home care service.

Some content is passed via **props**, while other parts are still hard-coded. Animations are implemented using **AOS (Animate On Scroll)** for smooth visual effects.

---

## Technologies Used
- **React** for component-based structure
- **HTML & CSS** for layout and styling
- **AOS (Animate On Scroll Library)** for animations
- No external CSS frameworks were used

---

## Features
- Smooth scrolling navigation to sections
- Animated elements using AOS
- Contact form with alert on submission
- Social media icons using **Remixicon**
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Design and Assets
- Logo created with **Canva**
- Background images and photos sourced from **Canva free resources**
- Icons used from **Remixicon**
- Layout designed to be clean, warm, and friendly for a family care brand
